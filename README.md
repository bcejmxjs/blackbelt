# Blackbelt
Blackbelt is a web app made (read WIP) with love for Melbourne Martial Arts.

## Tell me more
The application is targeted at karate dojos and will be available liberally via
the Apache 2.0 liscense.
We're intially using the [MEAN Stack](http://meanjs.org/) to build the application's foundation.
