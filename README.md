# Blackbelt
Blackbelt is a web app made (read WIP) with love for Melbourne Martial Arts.

## Tell me more
The application is targeted at karate dojos and will be available liberally via
the Apache 2.0 or MIT liscense.
We're intially using the [MEAN](http://meanjs.org/) stack to build the application's foundation.
